			<span class='boldTerm'>(d) EFFECT OF TERMINATION</span>

			<p>Any termination of this Agreement automatically terminates all rights and licenses granted to You under this Agreement, including all rights to use the Website and Services.

Upon termination, You shall cease any use of the Website and Services.

			<span class='boldTerm'>(e) LEGAL ACTION</span>

			<p>If HaiWai, in HaiWai's discretion, takes legal action against You in connection with any actual or suspected breach of this Agreement, HaiWai will be entitled to recover from You as part of such legal action, and You agree to pay, HaiWai's reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred as a result of such legal action.

			<h3>25. NOTICES</h3>

			<p>All notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement must be in writing.

			<h3>26. PARTIAL INVALIDITY</h3>

			<p>Should any part of this Agreement be declared invalid, void, or unenforceable by a Court of Competent Jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of any remaining portion hereof, which shall remain in full force and effect, and the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that they would have executed the remaining portion hereof without including the part so declared by a Court of Competent Jurisdiction, to be invalid, void, or unenforceable.</p>

			<h3>27. GENERAL</h3>

			<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between HaiWai and You concerning Your use of the Website and Services. This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of HaiWai or by the unilateral amendment of this Agreement by HaiWai and by the posting by HaiWai of such amended version. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. This Agreement and all of Your rights and obligations hereunder will not be assignable or transferable by You without the prior written consent of HaiWai. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns. You and HaiWai are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. Except for the HaiWai Parties and the Indemnified Parties as and to the extent set forth in Sections 7, 13, 20(a), 22, and 24(e), and in this paragraph, and HaiWai's licensors and suppliers as to the extent expressly stated in this Agreement, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement or infringement of proprietary or other third-party rights by You would cause irreparable injury to HaiWai and HaiWai's licensors and suppliers, and would therefore entitle HaiWai or HaiWai's licensors or suppliers, as the case may be, to injunctive relief. The headings in this Agreement are for the purpose of convenience only and shall not limit, enlarge, or affect any of the covenants, terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement.</p>
